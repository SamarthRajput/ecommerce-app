## 3. Installation Guide

To run this project locally, you'll need Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed. Follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd ecommerce-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    The application might require environment variables (API keys, database connection strings, etc.). Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary variables. Example:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
    API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

    Refer to the specific modules or documentation within the project to understand which environment variables are required.

## 4. Usage

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev (This command depends on your package.json configuration.  Check the scripts section for the correct command.)
    ```

    This will typically start the application on a development server (e.g., `localhost:3000`).  The exact address will be displayed in the console.

2.  **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to the address shown in the console.

Consult any specific documentation within the project for detailed instructions on how to use particular features.
